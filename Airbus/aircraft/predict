Predict Aircraft Age and Value – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Summary:

This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship between various features of Airbus aircraft and their impact on the aircraft’s age and estimated value. The “Airbus Aircrafts Dataset” was used to explore how technical, operational, and categorical characteristics influence aircraft lifecycle and market value. Both categorical and numerical features were analyzed using statistical summaries and visualizations.

About the Dataset:

The dataset includes records of different Airbus aircraft types, including metadata and technical specifications. It contains aircraft registration information, model, production year, number of engines, number of seats, operator, status (active/stored/retired), and more.

Key Features:

Model:
The aircraft model (e.g., A320, A330, A350, A380).

Status:
Operational status of the aircraft (active, parked, retired).

First_flight:
Year of the aircraft’s first flight. Used to compute the age of the aircraft.

Engines:
Number of engines installed on the aircraft.

Seats:
Estimated seating capacity of the aircraft.

Aircraft_type:
Passenger or cargo aircraft.

Operator:
Airline or company operating the aircraft.

Age:
Calculated from the current year minus the first flight year.

Value (estimated):
Target variable representing the aircraft’s estimated market value (if available or derived).

Objective:

The main objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between aircraft age and estimated value, and determine which features have the most significant influence on these variables. Additionally, this EDA aims to identify missing data, outliers, and patterns within the dataset.

Studies Conducted:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Checked for missing or inconsistent entries (e.g., missing production years or engine counts).

Converted categorical variables (e.g., model names, operator names) into appropriate formats.

Parsed and transformed date fields into usable features such as aircraft age.

Removed or flagged outliers in seating capacity, engine count, or anomalous production years.

2. Feature Engineering

Calculated aircraft age as: Age = Current Year - First Flight Year.

Classified aircraft status into operational categories.

Grouped aircraft models based on size or range.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for age, seat capacity, engines, etc.

Visualizations for categorical variables such as model distribution, aircraft status, and operator frequencies.

Correlation heatmap among numerical features (age, seats, engines, estimated value).

Distribution analysis of aircraft age across different models and statuses.

4. Visualizations

Histograms of aircraft age and seat count.

Boxplots comparing value across aircraft models or types.

Bar charts showing the number of aircraft per operator or status.

Scatter plots to show relationships between age and value, or seats and value.

5. Statistical Analysis

ANOVA tests to compare aircraft value across different models or engine counts.

Correlation analysis between age, seating capacity, and value.

Regression line plots to analyze linear trends (e.g., how age affects aircraft value).

Results:

Aircraft age is strongly associated with its operational status — newer aircraft are more likely to be active, while older ones are retired or stored.

Seating capacity and model type are good predictors of aircraft size and likely market value.

A negative correlation was observed between aircraft age and value, indicating depreciation over time.

Models like the A320 series showed a wide distribution of ages, while newer models like A350 were mostly under 10 years old.

Conclusions:

This EDA reveals key insights into how Airbus aircraft characteristics affect their operational lifecycle and value. Understanding these patterns can assist airline companies, lessors, and buyers in making informed decisions regarding fleet planning, acquisitions, and retirements.

Next Steps:

Use the findings as a basis for predictive modeling (e.g., regression or tree-based algorithms) to estimate aircraft value or predict remaining useful life.

Enhance feature engineering by incorporating external data (e.g., fuel efficiency, maintenance cost, utilization rate).

Build a Streamlit or Dash application where users can input aircraft features to estimate value or lifespan.
